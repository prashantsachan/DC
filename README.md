# DynamicCharts
<p>A d3 based library for few commonly used charts. </p>
<p>d3 is a low level javascript library giving you power to visualize data in almost any way. But every power comes with a responsibility. There are no pre-defined templates for common charts (such as barChart, lineChart etc.). Hence Dynamic Charts
</p>
<p> Here are the chart templates ready for you to use (and possibly contribute). 
* BarChart: see [barChart README] (./src/js/charts/barChart/README.md)
